# covidData


This project was primarily data exploration with SQL (SSMS).  I used a variety of functions to create new views (WITH(), OVER (Partition...), VIEW, JOIN, MAX, CAST, ISNULL aswell as basic math).  I'll be using the newly created views for creating visualizations in PowerBI (or Tablueau).
