# covidData

I used a SQL database (w/ SSMS) to explore a world-wide time series data collection of covid infections, testing, and demographic information. I used a variety of functions to create new views (WITH(), OVER (Partition...), VIEW, JOIN, MAX, CAST, ISNULL and basic math), that were ultimately visualised in TableAu.
